[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
I'm here because my left arm has been shaking uncontrollably for the past four days. It starts at my shoulder and the whole arm trembles, even though I'm a right-handed person.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, thank you for sharing that. When did this first start?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Honestly, I can't be certain about the exact date—it's been going on for four days, but I can't pinpoint the start time. I just know it began suddenly and hasn't gone away.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
Okay, thank you. Does anything make the shaking worse or better?

[Turn 6] Patient:
It seems to worsen when I'm stressed or anxious, but it calms down when I'm relaxed or resting.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
Thank you for that information. Any other symptoms or sensations you've noticed?

[Turn 8] Patient:
I've also been feeling unusually anxious lately, especially when the arm shaking occurs. A couple of times, I've experienced dizziness and felt a bit lightheaded, but nothing severe.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Thank you, that helps. Have you ever had anything like this before?

[Turn 10] Patient:
I'm afraid I can't recall anything like this before. I'm usually pretty forgetful about past issues, especially with all the anxiety I've had over the years.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
Thank you for sharing that. Let's talk about your anxiety. How often have you felt anxious recently?

[Turn 12] Patient:
It's been constant since the arm started shaking. I'm anxious pretty much all the time lately, especially when I think about what this could be. It started around the same time as the left arm shaking.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Thank you. Any dizziness or lightheadedness separate from the anxiety?

[Turn 14] Patient:
Yes, I've had dizziness and lightheadedness separate from the anxiety. It happened a couple of times, but I'm not sure when exactly.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
Thank you for sharing that. Have you experienced any other symptoms, like blurred vision or hearing changes?

[Turn 16] Patient:
No, nothing like that. I've only noticed the arm shaking and the anxiety.

[Turn 17] Doctor:
Thank you. Can you tell me about your current medications and any known allergies?

[Turn 18] Patient:
I take calcium carbonate and Vitamin D3, but I have to admit, I'm not sure about the dosage or how often I take them. I think I started the Vitamin D3 a while back, but I don’t remember why or when.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
Thank you. I'd like to check your Vitamin D levels to ensure there's no deficiency. Do you have any known allergies?

[Turn 20] Patient:
No known allergies, but honestly, I'm not sure. I've just been taking these supplements, but I don't remember any specific allergic reactions in the past.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Thank you. I'll order some tests to help figure things out. Before I do, can you tell me more about your past medical history?

[Turn 22] Patient:
About five years ago or so, I had a couple of seizures as a child. I also had that weird head exam done, and they found some strange results. I forget the details, to be honest. And yes, I've had anxiety for a while.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
TERMINATE

[Turn 24] Doctor:
Okay, thank you for sharing that information.

Based on the uncontrollable shaking in your left arm, the correlation with stress and anxiety, and your history of childhood issues, I believe you likely have Essential Tremor, with anxiety playing a significant role.

Other possibilities include:
1.  Anxiety disorder (possibly panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder) with secondary physical symptoms.
2.  A neurological condition, although less likely at this stage.
