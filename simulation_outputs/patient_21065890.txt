[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Oh, hello there, Doctor Smith. It feels like a relief to be here, though I must say, the wait was quite long. Let me tell you, I've been experiencing jaundice for the past week, and it’s been quite alarming. I remember thinking, is this something serious? Especially since I still have those gallstones that I was planning to get rid of with that cholecystectomy. But then, you know, during that pre-op check-up, they found carotid stenosis, and I had to have that CEA. It was quite an ordeal—my dysphagia required a J-tube, and I've been on Jevity 1.2 Cal ever since. I take metoprolol tartrate, aspirin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril daily. I guess I should mention that my symptoms have been getting progressively worse, starting with my skin turning yellow, then my eyes, and now I'm worried about my bile duct being obstructed.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, thank you for sharing that. To understand your jaundice better, could you tell me *when* it first started?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Well, Doctor Smith, it really started becoming noticeable about a week ago. I think it was around the time after my CEA procedure, you know, when I was having issues with my swallowing. The skin started turning yellow quite abruptly. I remember looking in the mirror one morning and noticing that my eyes had that greenish tint. And honestly, I was worried because I'd had some liver issues in the past—acute and subacute necrosis, if I recall correctly. It all felt like it came on suddenly, maybe even in the last few days before I came here. But I'm relieved to be here now, and I hope we can figure out what's going on.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
That's helpful. The jaundice started becoming noticeable about a week ago. Was there a specific date when you first noticed the yellowing?

[Turn 6] Patient:
Oh yes, Doctor, I can be quite specific about that. It started around the Monday following the third week of April. I remember distinctly that morning when I woke up, I noticed my skin seemed unusually yellow, almost like a patina of gold on my arms and legs. The sclerae in my eyes were quite pronounced. It was quite alarming, especially since I had just been discussing my gallstones with the cardiologist following the carotid stenosis diagnosis. The symptoms seemed to worsen progressively over the following days - I started having darker urine, and the stool became quite pale, like the color of paper. I called my family, and they insisted I come to the ER. I also started taking more of my Jevity 1.2 Cal since I wasn't eating much due to the persistent nausea. But the jaundice was definitely my main concern when I arrived.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
Has you had any fever or chills recently? This can help us understand if there's an underlying infection or inflammation contributing to your symptoms. Let me know how you're feeling otherwise, too.

[Turn 8] Patient:
No, Doctor, I haven't experienced any fever or chills at all. I've been feeling generally okay, except for the nausea and fatigue that has been bothering me. The nausea has been quite persistent, especially since I started taking the Jevity 1.2 Cal, though I suppose that's expected. I've also been feeling quite drained lately - I've noticed a significant drop in my energy levels since the jaundice began. It's as if my body is just not functioning optimally. I do sometimes have this low-grade fatigue that I've had for months now, but the jaundice has certainly made things worse.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Okay, that helps. How long has the nausea been bothering you, and did it start at the same time as the jaundice?

[Turn 10] Patient:
The nausea actually started around the same time as the jaundice, which is about a week ago. It began subtly, but has been a constant companion ever since. I've been feeling quite queasy, especially after eating, which is tricky because of my J-tube. I've been on Jevity 1.2 Cal for about a month now, following my dysphagia complication from the CEA. I'm hoping to eventually wean off it, but the nausea has made it difficult. It's not unbearable, but it's definitely noticeable, and I can't help but feel it's part of the bigger picture with my jaundice.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
That's good detail. Can you describe how the nausea feels and what makes it better or worse?

[Turn 12] Patient:
The nausea feels like a persistent, gnawing discomfort in my upper abdomen, though it's also intermittent. It's a dull ache that sometimes flares up, especially when I eat or when I lie down, which is why I try to sit upright as much as possible. Nothing really makes it better, but I find that if I eat smaller, more frequent meals, I feel a little more comfortable, though it's not a significant improvement. I've been on Jevity 1.2 Cal for about a month now, so I can't be sure if that's a contributing factor or not. It's been a real worry, especially with the jaundice making everything feel more pronounced.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Okay, that's useful information. Thank you for that. Now, just to connect the dots, did the nausea begin at the same time as the jaundice?

[Turn 14] Patient:
Oh yes, Doctor, absolutely. The nausea began at the same time as the jaundice. It started subtly, but has been a constant companion ever since. It's a dull ache that sometimes flares up, especially when I eat or when I lie down. I've been on Jevity 1.2 Cal for about a month now, so I can't be sure if that's a contributing factor or not. It's been a real worry, especially with the jaundice making everything feel more pronounced.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
Excellent, thank you for clarifying. Now, has anything else been bothering you recently that you haven't mentioned?

[Turn 16] Patient:
No, I don’t think I’ve left anything out, but let me expand a bit. The nausea and fatigue have been the main issues, but they’re really intertwined with the J-tube and Jevity. The nausea started around the same time as the jaundice, and it’s been a constant battle. It feels like a dull ache in my upper abdomen, and it’s worse when I eat, which is tricky with the J-tube. I’ve been on Jevity for about a month, and while it’s necessary, it doesn’t seem to alleviate the nausea much. The fatigue is also worse, and it’s a significant drop from my usual energy levels. I feel drained most of the time, and it’s hard to even get through the day without assistance from my family. I’m hoping that as things settle, I’ll feel better, but for now, it’s been quite challenging. I don’t think I’ve overlooked anything else, but I appreciate you asking for more details.

[Turn 17] Doctor:
We're making progress. Let's talk about the nausea for a moment. When you eat, especially with the J-tube and Jevity, does the nausea worsen or improve?

[Turn 18] Patient:
Oh, yes, Doctor, that's been quite a struggle. When I eat through the J-tube, the nausea seems to worsen. It starts as a dull ache but can intensify after a few minutes. It feels like my system is working overtime to process the Jevity 1.2 Cal, which I understand is necessary, but it doesn't sit well with me. Sometimes, I feel dizzy or lightheaded shortly after eating, which makes me concerned. I try to eat smaller portions, but honestly, even that doesn't always help. It's frustrating because I know I need to maintain my nutrition, but my body just doesn't seem to cooperate.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
Alright, that's very helpful information. Thank you for sharing that. I'll take that into consideration.

[Turn 20] Patient:
Oh yes, Doctor, it starts as soon as I eat, usually within the first ten minutes or so. It's like a wave that comes in, making it very difficult to continue eating. I've found that after a few bites, I often have to stop because I feel so queasy. And then, the dizziness sets in, which is always alarming. I try to eat small amounts throughout the day, but honestly, it doesn't make much difference. It feels like my body is struggling to keep up, even with the J-tube and Jevity. It's been a real challenge, and I'm hoping that we can find a way to make it more manageable.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you for sharing that. I'll take that into consideration.

[Turn 22] Patient:
Yes, Doctor, it's always right around the first ten minutes after starting my J-tube feeding. The nausea hits me like a wave, making it difficult to continue. I find myself having to stop eating quite quickly, sometimes just after a few bites. It's like my body is trying to reject the Jevity 1.2 Cal, even though I know it's necessary. I've tried eating smaller amounts, but honestly, it doesn't make much difference. The nausea and dizziness have been my constant companions since starting the J-tube, and they've only intensified with the onset of jaundice.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
Okay, that's helpful information. Thank you for sharing that. I'll take that into consideration.

[Turn 24] Patient:
Yes, Doctor, it's been a consistent part of my daily routine since I started the J-tube about a month ago. It's always right around the first ten minutes or so after beginning the J-tube feeding. The nausea hits me like a wave, making it very difficult to continue. I find myself having to stop eating quite quickly, sometimes just after a few bites. It's like my body is trying to reject the Jevity 1.2 Cal, even though I know it's necessary. I've tried eating smaller amounts, but honestly, it doesn't make much difference. The nausea and dizziness have been my constant companions since the beginning, and they've only intensified with the onset of the jaundice.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
Alright, thank you for that detailed information. That really helps me understand the pattern. Let's connect this to your overall condition. I'd like to run some blood tests to check your liver function and possibly other markers. Does that sound okay?

[Turn 26] Patient:
Oh yes, Doctor, blood tests sound... invasive, I suppose. I understand they're necessary, though. I've been through so many tests throughout my life - my gallstones were discovered during that cholecystectomy evaluation, my carotid stenosis was found during that pre-op check-up, and the CEA procedure was quite extensive. I'm always a bit apprehensive about invasive procedures, but I trust you and your team. I haven't had any blood tests since my last check-up, which was about two months ago. It feels like a long time, but I suppose it's good to have current information. I hope the results will help clarify what's been going on with my jaundice and the persistent nausea.

[Turn 27] Doctor:
I'll order some blood tests to check your liver function and other markers. This will help us understand what's going on and guide our treatment plan.

[Turn 28] Patient:
Oh yes, Doctor, those blood tests sound... standard procedure, I suppose. I understand they're necessary, though. I've been through so many tests throughout my life - my gallstones were discovered during that cholecystectomy evaluation, my carotid stenosis was found during that pre-op check-up, and the CEA procedure was quite extensive. I'm always a bit apprehensive about invasive procedures, but I trust you and your team. I haven't had any blood tests since my last check-up, which was about two months ago. It feels like a long time, but I suppose it's good to have current information. I hope the results will help clarify what's been going on with my jaundice and the persistent nausea. I'll be sure to mention this to my family as well, they've been so supportive since the CEA complications arose.

[Turn 29] Doctor:
I'll order some blood tests to check your liver function and other markers. This will help us understand what's going on and guide our treatment plan.

[Turn 30] Patient:
Oh yes, Doctor, blood tests sound... standard procedure, I suppose. I understand they're necessary, though.

[Turn 31] Doctor:
Thank you for the detailed information.

Based on your symptoms, history, and the rapid onset of jaundice with these specific features, I believe you have **an acute obstructive cholestatic process.**

Other possibilities include:
*   Gallstone-related cholestasis
*   A biliary tumor or stricture
*   Medication-induced cholestasis
