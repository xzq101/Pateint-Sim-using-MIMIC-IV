[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Syncope, I passed out. Fell and hit my head.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, we'll get through this together. Tell me, did you have any warning signs before you passed out?

[Turn 4] Patient:
No, I don't remember. This just happened.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
How hard was the fall and hit to your head? Any symptoms from that injury now?

[Turn 6] Patient:
It was a hard fall. Head's hurting now, don't remember much else.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
How bad is the headache on a scale of 1 to 10?

[Turn 8] Patient:
Bad, 10 out of 10. Can't think straight.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
We need to be careful with head injuries. Let me check your pupils. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?

[Turn 10] Patient:
Fine. Point it. Whatever you need to do.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
We're checking things out carefully. Are you having any other symptoms? Any nausea or vomiting?

[Turn 12] Patient:
Not really. Just headache and confusion.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Let me get some IV fluids started for you. We need to keep you hydrated and keep an eye on you closely. I'll order some tests.

[Turn 14] Patient:
Passed out, doctor. That's what I'm worried about. What's wrong with me?

[Turn 15] Doctor:
TERMINATE

[Turn 16] Doctor:
Thank you for the information. Based on your symptoms, I believe you have post-traumatic syncope secondary to a head injury with suspected concussion.

Possible other causes include intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac syncope.
