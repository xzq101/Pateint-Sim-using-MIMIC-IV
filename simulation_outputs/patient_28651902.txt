[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Headache and stomach ache. Started drinking again last night.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, thanks for sharing. When did the headache and stomach ache start?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Last night. Had wine around 9 pm. Started feeling it then.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
Okay, that helps. How long have you had the headache so far?

[Turn 6] Patient:
About 12 hours. It just keeps getting worse.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
And the stomach ache? Has it been bothering you too?

[Turn 8] Patient:
Yeah, it's bothering me, but not as bad as my head. I've had this problem before with my stomach too.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
I'll order some tests.

[Turn 10] Patient:
Tests? What kind? I want to know what's going on.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
TERMINATE

[Turn 12] Doctor:
Thank you for sharing all that information.

Based on your symptoms, primarily a severe headache and stomach ache starting after drinking wine, my primary diagnosis is acute dehydration likely related to alcohol consumption, possibly combined with alcohol-induced gastritis.

Other possibilities include:
1.  Severe hangover effects.
2.  Recurrent migraine or tension headache triggered by alcohol.
