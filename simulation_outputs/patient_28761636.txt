[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Dr. Smith, I needed to come to the Emergency Department because I experienced sudden-onset vertigo this morning. It started at about 8:30 am while I was watching television. When I turned off the TV, I felt as though the room was spinning. I found that moving my head made it worse, and I became quite nauseous. I couldn't get out of bed to use the restroom, and my balance was completely off, so I couldn’t walk.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Let me ask a few more questions.

When did you actually get to the Emergency Department today?

How severe was the nausea? Did you vomit at all?

Was there any hearing loss or ringing in your ears?

Have you had any head trauma recently?

Did you experience any difficulty speaking, double vision, or weakness anywhere in your body?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Dr. Smith, I arrived here just about a little over three hours ago. The nausea has been pretty uncomfortable, but I haven't actually thrown up. I didn't experience any hearing loss, though I do have some ongoing ringing in my ears from time to time. No, I haven't had any head trauma recently. And I'm feeling fine with my speech and vision - no double vision or weakness at all.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
That helps me understand the situation better. Let me ask a few more questions.

What medical conditions do you have in your past history?

Are you currently taking any medications or have any known allergies?

Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?

Is there any history of similar symptoms in your family?

Have you had vertigo or dizziness before?

[Turn 6] Patient:
Dr. Smith, let me think about my history. I have a history of cerebral artery occlusion and a prior infarction. I've also dealt with other peripheral vertigo and tinnitus. I'm diagnosed with other forms of migraine, though not intractable. And yes, I have hyperlipidemia that's diet-controlled. As for current medications, I take B complex vitamins, Align probiotic, Citracal plus D, and usually a multivitamin too. But I seem to have forgotten about my cholesterol medication this time. I don't think I have any allergies. I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, and I don't use any recreational drugs. I'm not sure about family history, to be honest. But I do remember having vertigo before, though I can't recall too many details about it.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
That's very helpful information. Thank you for sharing that.

Let me ask you about the current episode.

How long has this particular bout of vertigo lasted?

Does the nausea come and go, or is it mostly constant?

Did you experience any headache associated with this episode?

[Turn 8] Patient:
This vertigo and nausea began right at 8:30 this morning. It's been almost continuously since then, though I don't know if it's been exactly constant. I definitely feel it as soon as I move my head or open my eyes. As for the headache, I started getting a dull pain in my temple about an hour ago, just after I started feeling the nausea. I'm not sure if that's connected or not.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Okay, that helps us piece things together. Let's focus on the headache.

Can you describe the headache? Is it constant, or does it come and go?

[Turn 10] Patient:
The headache is dull and has been pretty much constant since it started. It's primarily on one side, by my temple. It doesn't throb or pulsate like some headaches I've had before. It's just... there. And it's been bothering me ever since it began.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
Thank you for that information. Let me ask about your overall condition.

On a scale of 0 to 10, how severe is this headache?

[Turn 12] Patient:
On a scale of 0 to 10, I'd say the headache is a 4 out of 10. It's definitely there and annoying, but not the worst pain I've ever felt. I've had worse migraines in the past, but I don't remember exactly what they were like.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Thank you for that. I'll order some tests to help us determine the cause of your symptoms.

Let me examine you to check for signs that might help with the diagnosis.

Would you like to proceed?

[Turn 14] Patient:
Yes, please go ahead. I trust the doctors here and want to help figure out what's causing this. I hope it's not too complicated.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
TERMINATE

[Turn 16] Doctor:
Thank you for staying with me while I gathered this comprehensive history.

Based on all the information you provided, I believe you have suffered an episode of acute vestibular syndrome.

Other possibilities include a stroke, vestibular migraine, or vestibular neuritis.
