[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Ugh, fine. I got referred here from Dr. Garcia's clinic. I've been feeling weak, and I got this abdominal pain. But yeah, the real problem is all the blood. Like, bright red stuff showing up around my mouth and neck a lot—like twice a day, basically. And I woke up with it today three times already.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, thanks for sharing that. When did you first notice this happen?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Honestly, I can't give you an exact date. It just sort of happened. But it's been going on for a while now. Can you help me narrow it down?

[Turn 5] Doctor:
Any idea at all how long it's been going on? Maybe a rough timeframe like months or years?

[Turn 6] Patient:
No clue at all.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
Okay, let's see. Besides these recent episodes, were there any times in the past when you didn't have this at all?

[Turn 8] Patient:
No, didn't stop for long. It just kept coming back.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Any blood in your vomit come from your stomach or further down your digestive system?

[Turn 10] Patient:
It came right out of my stomach, I think. That's the best I can figure.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
Got it. If that blood came from your stomach, is it more likely from your upper GI system or lower digestive tract?

[Turn 12] Patient:
I don't know. I just know it came from my stomach.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Okay. When does this abdominal pain happen in relation to these blood episodes?

[Turn 14] Patient:
It usually comes right after.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
And how soon after did you pass out or faint?

[Turn 16] Patient:
Not like that. I don't faint.

[Turn 17] Doctor:
Okay. Any dizziness or lightheadedness after these episodes?

[Turn 18] Patient:
Not much, maybe a bit, but nothing major.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
Okay, any other symptoms at all besides the weakness and abdominal pain?

[Turn 20] Patient:
Yeah, sometimes I see a little mucus too.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Okay, and any other symptoms at all? For instance, the mucus itself – is it red, yellow, or clear?

[Turn 22] Patient:
Sometimes it's red.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
Any other symptoms at all? For instance, how does your stool look?

[Turn 24] Patient:
Fine.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
Okay, and any other symptoms at all? For instance, how severe is the weakness you feel?

[Turn 26] Patient:
Not too severe.

[Turn 27] Doctor:
Okay, thank you for letting me know. Any other symptoms at all? For instance, anything with your skin or eyes?

[Turn 28] Patient:
Fine.

[Turn 29] Doctor:
Any nausea or vomiting at all?

[Turn 30] Patient:
Not that. Got blood.

[Turn 31] Doctor:
Thank you for the thorough information.

Based on your symptoms, I believe you have upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely originating from a source like an ulcer or gastritis.

Other possibilities include Mallory-Weiss tears or chronic conditions like celiac disease.
