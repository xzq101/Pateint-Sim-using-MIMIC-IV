[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
I came because I felt short of breath and had a bad cough.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, thanks. Can you tell me when this first started?

[Turn 4] Patient:
I think it's been a while, maybe weeks?

[Turn 5] Doctor:
Thanks for that. Can you describe the cough— is it dry or productive?

[Turn 6] Patient:
The cough is productive. I cough up some green stuff.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
Okay, thanks. Where is the cough mostly located when you cough?

[Turn 8] Patient:
It's mostly in the chest.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Okay. How long have you been feeling this shortness of breath?

[Turn 10] Patient:
Dunno exactly, maybe a day or two.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
Thanks. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is this shortness of breath right now?

[Turn 12] Patient:
About a 5 out of 10. It's not great, but not terrible.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Thanks for sharing that. Did you have any recent cold or flu-like symptoms?

[Turn 14] Patient:
Yes, I had some fever and chills yesterday.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
Thanks. Have you been on any antibiotics for it?

[Turn 16] Patient:
Yes, I took some antibiotics last year.

[Turn 17] Doctor:
Thanks. Are you allergic to any medications?

[Turn 18] Patient:
I'm allergic to benadryl and aspirin. But I don't think I'm allergic to other medicines.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
Thanks for that. Are you allergic to any other medications?

[Turn 20] Patient:
I don't remember all the medications I take. I just know there are a few.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Thanks. Are you taking any medications for chronic conditions like heart or high blood pressure?

[Turn 22] Patient:
No, I don't think so.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
Thanks. Do you smoke?

[Turn 24] Patient:
Yes, I smoked in the past.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
Thanks. How often did you smoke?

[Turn 26] Patient:
I started smoking when I was about 18. Two packs a day.

[Turn 27] Doctor:
Thanks. Did you quit smoking recently?

[Turn 28] Patient:
Not for a while, maybe years ago.

[Turn 29] Doctor:
Thanks. Are you currently taking any medications?

[Turn 30] Patient:
I take albuterol for my breathing. I also take Symbicort. And Zyrtec for allergies. Diltiazem for my blood pressure. And divalproex.

[Turn 31] Doctor:
Thank you for sharing all that information. Based on your symptoms, smoking history, and exam findings, I believe you have community-acquired pneumonia. Other possibilities include acute bronchitis or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
