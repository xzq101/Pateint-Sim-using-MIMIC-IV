[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Well hello there, Doctor Smith. So, I'm here today because I'm experiencing some pretty intense right flank pain. It's been bothering me for a couple of days now, and it's really uncomfortable. I also have a fever that's been pretty high, around 103 degrees, and I'm getting these cold flashes that make me feel pretty shaky. I had lithotripsy just two days ago, and I think this pain might be related to that, but I wasn't feeling good anyway. It's definitely been quite uncomfortable, and I wanted to get it checked out as soon as possible.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, thank you for sharing that. When did the pain first start?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Well, the pain started about two days ago. I woke up in the middle of the night, maybe around 3 AM, and that's when it first got bad. I was trying to go back to sleep, but lying down just made it worse. It was sharp, right there on my right side, near my kidney area. By the time I got up, it was pretty intense. I thought maybe something was wrong because I'd just had lithotripsy last week, you know? And now I'm having this pain that feels like those stones might be breaking up again. But it was different this time—more constant, and I started feeling really cold. I got chills and my temperature just skyrocketed. I'm no expert, but I knew I needed to get to the ER. The pain is still 9 out of 10 now, and it radiates down towards my groin. It's really uncomfortable, and I'm worried about what's going on.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
Tell me more about the pain itself. Does it radiate anywhere else?

[Turn 6] Patient:
Oh, the pain is definitely sharp and intense, doctor. Right there on the right side, just under my ribs. It feels like it's right in the kidney area, and it's been pretty much constant since it started. When I try to move, it gets worse—like if I twist or bend down, it just shoots up again. It also seems to radiate down towards my groin, like it's moving down into the ureter. I can't even find a position that really helps—lying down makes it worse, and sitting on the edge of the bed doesn't do much either. I've been pacing around, hoping it would go away, but it's been pretty much the same for the last two days. It started at night, around 3 AM, and I just haven't been able to sleep since then. And to top it all off, I'm running a fever and getting these awful chills. It feels like something serious is going on, especially since I had that procedure just two days ago.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
That's concerning. Let's focus on your kidneys. Have you passed any urine recently?

[Turn 8] Patient:
Yes, I have urinated, but it's been a bit troublesome. I think I've urinated about four times in the past 24 hours, but I feel like I need to go more often than usual. It's not painful exactly, but it does get uncomfortable, especially when I'm trying to urinate. I don't think I've noticed any blood in the urine, but I'm not sure. It's been a rough couple of days since my lithotripsy. I really thought that procedure would help, but here I am again with this pain and fever. It's just really unsettling, especially for someone my age with my medical history.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
How are you feeling otherwise? Any nausea or vomiting?

[Turn 10] Patient:
I feel pretty nauseous, doctor, but I don't know if it's the fever or just the anxiety of all this. It's not a strong nausea, though—more of a queasy feeling sometimes, especially when I move suddenly. I don't think I've actually thrown up, but I've had to sit down a couple of times when it got too much. It's just part of the whole miserable feeling I've had since the pain started. I'm also feeling quite fatigued, like I don't have much energy, and I've noticed I'm a bit short of breath, but that might just be the fever playing tricks on me. It's all been going on since about 3 AM yesterday, and it hasn't let up much since. I remember thinking about my medical history—my bladder cancer and diabetes—while this was going on. It feels like something that could be related to all that, but I don't want to jump to conclusions.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
Let's get your full health picture. What is your past medical history?

[Turn 12] Patient:
Doctor, well, I'm 62 years old, so I guess that's relevant. I've had some health issues over the years. First, the kidneys—I was diagnosed with hydronephrosis not too long ago. I also had a urinary tract infection, but I don't remember much about it. Then there was that time when I had bacteremia. And of course, there's the bladder cancer part of my history—I had a case of that back in the day. Right now, I take Metformin for my type II diabetes and Lipitor to manage my cholesterol. It's been a lot to keep track of over the years, but I try to stay on top of my health as best I can.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Excellent, thank you for that. What medications do you take daily?

[Turn 14] Patient:
I take Metformin for my diabetes and Lipitor for my cholesterol. I usually take them once a day, but I think I take Metformin twice a day. I'm not sure about the exact dosage, but I take them regularly as prescribed.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
Got it. Any allergies to medications?

[Turn 16] Patient:
Nope, doctor. I don't think I have any allergies to medications, but I've heard people talk about being allergic to penicillin. I'm not sure if it's true or not. Does that mean I shouldn't take anything?

[Turn 17] Doctor:
Do you have any known drug allergies, even if unsure?

[Turn 18] Patient:
No, doctor, I don't think I have any allergies. I just heard some people are allergic to penicillin, but I don't know if that's true for me or not. It's just something I've heard about.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
Thanks for letting me know. Do you ever have any reaction to any specific medications?

[Turn 20] Patient:
No, doctor. I don't think so. I take those two pills every day, and nothing really happens when I take them. I just get that queasy feeling sometimes, but I think that's from the fever. If I had some kind of allergic reaction, I would probably remember something. Right now, I'm just feeling really uncomfortable with this pain and fever.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
How much fluid do you drink daily? And can you tell me about your urine output or color?

[Turn 22] Patient:
I try to drink plenty of water, maybe 6-8 glasses a day. I drink more when I feel like I'm getting sick. As for urine, I pee more often now than usual, maybe every hour or so. I don't think I've noticed any big changes in the color, but I'm not really paying attention to it. I just know it's something I should be monitoring, especially with everything else going on.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
That's helpful. How much did you drink before you urinated last time?

[Turn 24] Patient:
I think I had about 16 ounces of water and maybe some orange juice. It was just after I woke up, around 7 AM. I remember thinking maybe I should pee soon. And I did—I went about an hour after that. I said to myself, "Wow, I'm really drinking a lot today." I've noticed that I have to pee more often than usual, maybe every hour. It's been like that since the pain started last night. I just hope that means I'm staying hydrated and nothing serious is going on, especially with my medical history.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
What color is your urine now? And what's your temperature?

[Turn 26] Patient:
It's clear, doctor. Not the deep yellow I usually see when I'm not drinking enough. And my temperature is 102.5°F now. I took a quick reading just a few minutes ago. It feels like I'm burning up, especially with the chills I've been having, but the urine is clear. I just hope that means I'm staying hydrated and nothing serious is going on, especially with all this going on.

[Turn 27] Doctor:
I'd like to run some blood tests and check your urine. Is that okay with you?

[Turn 28] Patient:
Yes, doctor, that's fine. I understand that these tests will help figure out what's going on. I've been feeling pretty bad over the past couple of days, and I want to make sure everything is checked out properly. My temperature is still high, and the pain isn't getting any better despite the fluids I've been drinking. I think these tests are a good idea since I had my lithotripsy just a couple of days ago and this seems worse than anything from the stones before.

[Turn 29] Doctor:
Let me examine you to check your vital signs and listen to your lungs and abdomen. Anything else you want to mention?

[Turn 30] Patient:
You can check my lungs and abdomen, doctor. The pain isn't letting up, and I'm still burning up with fever. I'm having trouble sleeping because the pain keeps me awake, and I've been pacing around all night. I also feel like I need to pee more often, but when I do, it's not painful. I just wish I knew what was going on so I could get some peace of mind, especially with my medical history.

[Turn 31] Doctor:
Okay, thank you for sharing all of that important information. We'll get those tests started.

Based on everything we've talked about, especially the right-sided flank pain, fever, chills, nausea, and your recent lithotripsy procedure, the PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS is likely **acute pyelonephritis**.

Other possibilities include **urinary tract infection (UTI)** or **acute abdomen** issues.
