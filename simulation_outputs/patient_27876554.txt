[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Vaginal bleeding.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, vaginal bleeding. When did this start?

[Turn 4] Patient:
This evening.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
How much bleeding are you having? Any pain?

[Turn 6] Patient:
Not sure. Just bright red blood on the toilet paper. No pain.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
Okay, let's find out what's normal for you. When was your last period?

[Turn 8] Patient:
Don't remember. Been a long time.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Okay, how much blood are you soaking up each pad? Up to two pads an hour?

[Turn 10] Patient:
Don't know. Just noticed it this evening.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
Okay, how long has it been going on since you noticed it?

[Turn 12] Patient:
Just started.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Okay, how much blood are you soaking up each pad or tampon?

[Turn 14] Patient:
This is frustrating. I don't know. I just noticed it.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
Okay, I understand. Let's figure this out. What was your last period?

[Turn 16] Patient:
I don't remember. Sorry.

[Turn 17] Doctor:
Let me ask something else. What is your age?

[Turn 18] Patient:
Eighty-two.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
Any other symptoms, like urinary issues?

[Turn 20] Patient:
Just the usual.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Is this bleeding different from what you usually have?

[Turn 22] Patient:
I don't remember. Sorry.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
Okay, let's check your medications. Are you taking anything regularly?

[Turn 24] Patient:
Coumadin.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
Okay, what is your Coumadin dose? When was your last dose?

[Turn 26] Patient:
Forgot. Sorry.

[Turn 27] Doctor:
Okay, let's see what else is going on. Are you feeling dizzy or faint at all?

[Turn 28] Patient:
Nope.

[Turn 29] Doctor:
Okay, let's find the cause. Have you had this bleed before?

[Turn 30] Patient:
Nope. Forgot. Sorry.

[Turn 31] Doctor:
Thank you for sharing that information. Based on your symptoms, I believe you have vaginal bleeding likely related to atrophic changes or irritation, possibly exacerbated by Coumadin use. However, other possibilities include cervical issues or underlying gynecological conditions requiring further investigation.
