[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Doctor, I just found out I'm low on platelets. That's why I came here.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
What made you come to the ER specifically about low platelets?

[Turn 4] Patient:
I keep bleeding a lot. And my skin is full of bruises.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
How long has this bleeding and bruising been happening?

[Turn 6] Patient:
About two weeks ago. Started right after my surgery.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
Was the surgery you recently had major or minor? Just so I know what kind.

[Turn 8] Patient:
It was major. A valve sparing ascending aorta replacement.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Did you start any new medications around the time of your surgery?

[Turn 10] Patient:
I think I started some new meds, but I'm not sure. Everything was just a blur after the surgery.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
Okay, that's helpful information. Any specific medications were you discharged on after your surgery?

[Turn 12] Patient:
I don't remember. Everything is just a mess. I can't piece it together right now.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Any specific medications like Eliquis or Coumadin? Just guessing, but any at all?

[Turn 14] Patient:
I... uh... I'm not sure. I don't remember the names. Everything was just a lot.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
Would you have been given more than one pill per day or a specific color pill?

[Turn 16] Patient:
Nope. I don't know. I can't remember.

[Turn 17] Doctor:
Were you taking any of these medications for a specific period of time?

[Turn 18] Patient:
Honestly, I don't know. Not a clue.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
And how often were you taking these medications, if you could?

[Turn 20] Patient:
Nope, I don't know that either. Everything is fuzzy.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Okay, let's focus on what's happening now. How are you feeling today, besides the bleeding and bruising?

[Turn 22] Patient:
Uh... sometimes I feel tired. Not sure if that's related.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
Any other symptoms at all?

[Turn 24] Patient:
Not really nothing else.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
I'll order some tests to help us figure out what's going on with your platelets.

[Turn 26] Patient:
I don't know. I just know I look like I'm bleeding.

[Turn 27] Doctor:
TERMINATE

[Turn 28] Doctor:
Thank you for the full history.

Based on your symptoms starting post-surgery, I believe you have thrombocyt'topenia. Other possibilities include post-operative bleeding and possible medication effects.
