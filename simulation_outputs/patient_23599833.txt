[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
Doctor, I came because I've been feeling dizzy and weak for about a week.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, thanks for letting me know. When did this first start?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Doctor, it started gradually on a Tuesday six days ago.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
Exactly. And how long does it last each time?

[Turn 6] Patient:
Doctor, it comes and goes. Sometimes it lasts all day, other times just a few hours.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
Great. Any specific things like standing up that makes it worse?

[Turn 8] Patient:
Doctor, yeah, I think that makes it worse. When I stand up, I feel weaker.

Doctor, what medications do you currently take?

[Turn 20] Patient:
Doctor, I take lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, Januvia, and pravastatin.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Doctor, do you feel any other symptoms like constipation, dizziness, or fainting?

[Turn 22] Patient:
Doctor, I sometimes have constipation, and I've been feeling dizzy and faint.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
Doctor, how long have you been having the constipation?

[Turn 24] Patient:
Doctor, about a month.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
Doctor, how often do you have a bowel movement?

[Turn 26] Patient:
Doctor, maybe once every few days. It's not normal.

Doctor, have you noticed any other symptoms recently?

[Turn 28] Patient:
Doctor, I feel tired or weak most of the time.

[Turn 29] Doctor:
Doctor, have you ruled out low blood sugar?

[Turn 30] Patient:
Doctor, I don't think about checking my blood sugar. I haven't been.

[Turn 31] Doctor:
Thank you for sharing all that information. Based on your symptoms, I believe you're experiencing orthostatic hypotension, likely related to your medications. Other possibilities include dehydration or anemia.
