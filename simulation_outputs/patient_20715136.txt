[Turn 1] Doctor:
Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to the Emergency Department?

[Turn 2] Patient:
I fell off the commode and hurt my wrist. It's really sore.

[Turn 3] Doctor:
Okay, that sounds painful. Let me ask about the fall: Did you fall straight onto your wrist?

[Turn 4] Patient:
Not straight up, I pushed myself up.

[Turn 5] Doctor:
Did your wrist swell up or can you bend it much at all?

[Turn 6] Patient:
No swelling. Bending is not much.

[Turn 7] Doctor:
How much pain do you feel when you try to move your wrist?

[Turn 8] Patient:
Not much, just a little.

[Turn 9] Doctor:
Does the pain radiate anywhere else, like into your arm or down your hand?

[Turn 10] Patient:
No, just wrist.

[Turn 11] Doctor:
What happens if you try to bend your wrist more? Does it hurt worse?

[Turn 12] Patient:
A little, but okay.

[Turn 13] Doctor:
Can you make a fist or turn your wrist the other way?

[Turn 14] Patient:
A little, but okay. Turning it is better.

[Turn 15] Doctor:
Okay, that's helpful. When you turn your wrist like this, does it still feel okay?

[Turn 16] Patient:
Not bad. It's okay.

[Turn 17] Doctor:
Any numbness or tingling in your fingers?

[Turn 18] Patient:
No, not at all.

[Turn 19] Doctor:
What kind of pain do you have—sharp or dull? And where exactly on your wrist does it hurt?

[Turn 20] Patient:
It's just a little, right there.

[Turn 21] Doctor:
Let me ask again about the location—can you point to exactly where the pain is?

[Turn 22] Patient:
Yes, here.

[Turn 23] Doctor:
Is there a specific spot on your wrist that is tender to touch?

[Turn 24] Patient:
Yes, here. Right there.

[Turn 25] Doctor:
Is your wrist warm to the touch, or does it look red?

[Turn 26] Patient:
Nope, not warm. Not red. It's just like this.

[Turn 27] Doctor:
How did you fall, and have you had any similar injuries in the past?

[Turn 28] Patient:
I pushed myself up. Yes, I broke my wrist before.

[Turn 29] Doctor:
Any chronic conditions you have, like diabetes or heart problems?

[Turn 30] Patient:
Yes, I have high blood pressure. No diabetes.

[Turn 31] Doctor:
Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on your fall and the pain and tenderness in your wrist, I believe you have suffered a **wrist fracture, likely a repeat injury given your history**.

Other possibilities include:
*   A **wrist sprain**.
*   Underlying **osteoporosis**, which increases fracture risk.
